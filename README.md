# navigatAR

Finding your way through buildings and campuses through the power of augmented reality

> navigatAR is an iOS app that shows you where to go in an accessible, user-friendly way. No more asking for directions or searching for a map, you can use a simple app instead. navigatAR leverages the power of augmented reality to provide indoor directions to areas, rooms, and even events, displayed by arrows that show you where to go in real-time.

## Technologies

We created an native Swift iOS app that used ARKit for augmented reality and Indoor Atlas for indoor positioning. Throughout the development process we used Slack for communication and GitHub projects to keep track of what features were in progress.

## Installation

First, install Xcode, navigate to the `/navigatAR` directory in the root of the project, then run:

```
$ pod install
```

## Hackathon

The MICDS team won third place out of 20 schools winning $2,500 for our school!
